"""HTTP client for the LEAN Sidecar launcher service.

The data-plane (``polygon-data-service`` container) reaches the
launcher over HTTP. The launcher is a separate process — by design,
per ``docs/architecture/lean-sidecar-lab.md`` §"Launcher topology" —
so the data plane cannot escalate by exploiting the FastAPI handlers.

This module is the single seam between the data plane and the
launcher. It turns the launcher's structured 400 responses
(``{reason, message}``) into typed Python exceptions so the service
layer can branch on them without parsing free-text.
