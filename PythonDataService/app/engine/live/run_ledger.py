"""Live-runtime run identity — ``LiveRunLedger`` and builder.

Per spec ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-ibkr-paper-shadow-deployment-design.md``
section 10. Distinct from the backtest-side ``app.research.runs.ledger.RunLedger``
which captures deterministic-replay identity for a backtest; this ledger
captures the inputs that pin a *live* paper run's identity.

``run_id`` = ``sha256(canonical_json(identity_payload))`` over:
  * ``code_sha`` — git HEAD on run-start commit. Required, must be non-empty.
    The dirty-tree refusal in ``pre_flight.check_clean_tree`` is what makes
    this meaningful — runs from a dirty tree do not start.
  * ``strategy_spec_path`` + ``strategy_spec_sha256`` — the
    ``StrategySpec`` JSON contract being run.
  * ``qc_audit_copy_sha256`` — sha256 of the checked-in QC audit copy
    (``references/qc-shadow/SpyEmaCrossoverAlgorithm.py``).
  * ``qc_cloud_backtest_id`` — operator-supplied identifier of the QC
    Cloud backtest that proves the QC Cloud execution copy is in sync
    with the audit copy.
  * ``live_config`` — resolved values, not raw env vars.
  * ``account_id`` — DU… account id from IBKR.
  * ``start_date_ms`` — int64 ms UTC, the first bar's session start.

Reuses the canonical-JSON SHA-256 helper at
``app.research.runs.hashing`` rather than reinventing the contract.
