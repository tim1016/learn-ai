"""Fold registry — the pure, replayable current-state derivation PRD Phase 1
calls for ("keep the fold a pure, replayable function").

A fold is keyed by ``transition_kind`` (not passed as an ad-hoc closure at
append time) so the *same* lookup drives both live appends and mirror-rebuild
replay — rebuild only has the recovered ``transition_kind`` + payload to work
from, not whatever closure a live caller happened to pass in.

Slice 2 (#1375) registers exactly one fold, ``STRATEGY_INSTANCE_REGISTERED``,
because bot registration is the one piece of business state this slice
legitimately owns (it needs no command/effect lifecycle to be meaningful).
Slices 3+ extend ``DEFAULT_FOLD_REGISTRY`` with their own transition kinds
rather than growing an if/elif chain here or in the repository.
